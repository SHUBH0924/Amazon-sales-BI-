# README — Amazon\_prepinsta BI

## Project Title

**Amazon\_prepinsta BI**

## Overview

This Power BI project (Amazon\_prepinsta.pbix) provides interactive dashboards and visualizations designed to analyze Amazon-related dataset(s) prepared for PrepInsta-style insights. The report includes data-cleaning logic, measures, visuals and filters to support sales, performance and trend analysis.

## Files

* `Amazon_prepinsta.pbix` — Main Power BI Desktop file (contains data model, visuals, and queries).

> If you received additional files (CSV, Excel, JSON, or database connection details), place them in the same folder as the PBIX or reconfigure data source paths inside Power BI Query Editor.

## Prerequisites

* Power BI Desktop (recommended latest version). Download from Microsoft Store or Power BI website.
* Access to any external data sources used (if applicable): databases, APIs, or cloud storage.

## How to open

1. Install Power BI Desktop if not already installed.
2. Double-click `Amazon_prepinsta.pbix` or open Power BI Desktop → File → Open → select the PBIX file.
3. If prompted, update data source credentials (see Data Sources below).

## Data Sources & Credentials

* The PBIX may contain embedded data or live connections to sources (CSV/Excel, SQL, API). To inspect or change sources:

  * Home → Transform data → Power Query Editor → Right-panel "Queries".
  * Click each query → Source step to view the original file/connection.
* To update credentials: Home → Transform data → Data source settings → Edit Permissions.
* If sources were moved/renamed, fix the path in the Query Editor or re-point the source to the current file location.

## Refreshing Data

* In Power BI Desktop: Home → Refresh to re-run queries and update visuals.
* If you publish to Power BI Service and use scheduled refresh, configure a gateway (if connecting to on-premises sources) and set credentials in the service.

## Pages & Key Visuals

* **Overview / Executive Dashboard** — High-level KPIs and trend charts.
* **Sales / Performance** — Detailed metrics by category, product, or time.
* **Customer Insights** — Customer segmentation and behavior visuals (if available).
* **Data Quality / ETL** — Steps showing transformations and any data validation visuals.

(Exact page names may vary — open the PBIX to view the exact tabs.)

## Measures & Calculations

* The report includes DAX measures for common metrics (e.g., Total Sales, YoY Growth, Average Order Value). Check the Model view or Fields pane to review measure formulas.

## Assumptions & Notes

* Any business assumptions made during modeling (e.g., fiscal calendar starts in April, returns excluded) should be documented here. If not included in the report, ask the author for details.
* Date table: the PBIX should contain a properly configured Date table. If not, create one and mark as Date Table for accurate time intelligence.

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

* If visuals fail after moving the PBIX: check Query Editor for broken source steps.
* If performance is slow: consider disabling background data previews in Query Editor or reducing loaded rows while developing.
* If scheduled refresh fails in Power BI Service: check gateway status and credential settings.

## Exporting & Publishing

* Export report page to PDF / PowerPoint: File → Export → PDF or PowerPoint.
* Publish to Power BI Service: Home → Publish, then choose a workspace.

## Contribution & Versioning

* Save iteration versions like `Amazon_prepinsta_v1.pbix`, `Amazon_prepinsta_v2.pbix`.
* Keep a changelog (simple `CHANGELOG.md`) for major updates: date, author, summary of changes.

## License & Sharing

* Confirm any data-sharing restrictions before publishing to shared workspaces.

## Contact / Author

* For questions about data definitions, calculations, or to request modifications, contact the report owner or author (add name/email here).

*Notes: This README is a general guide. Open the `Amazon_prepinsta.pbix` file to inspect specifics (page names, measures, and data sources). If you want, I can add a customized changelog, a short data dictionary, or create a quick checklist for publishing to Power BI Service.*
